                <h3>Agentic AI</h3><hr>
                <p>Agentic AI extends traditional AI by giving systems autonomy to make decisions and take actions without constant human input. These AI “agents” can plan, reason, and execute tasks based on goals, feedback, and environmental changes. It combines reasoning, memory, and tool usage to perform multi-step tasks efficiently. This makes it useful for business automation, customer support, and research assistance.</p>
